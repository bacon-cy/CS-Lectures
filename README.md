## Data Structure
Note : https://hackmd.io/@bacon-cy/HywNyxA-i

- Prefix, Postfix, Infix
- min Heap
  - insert x : Add a new node, which value is x into the min heap.
  - remove : Remove the key with the lowest value, and print the value and breakline. If the heap is empty, print empty.
  - change x,y : Change the value in the node x to y. If x is out of range, print out of range.(x : index, y : value)
- Kruskalâ€™s algorithm : minimum cost spanning tree
  - input file:  The first line shows V and E. V represents the vertice number while E is the edge number.
    The rest shows the edge detail. Each line contains s, t and c, which means there is an edge between s and v with cost c.
- F-heap : priority queue
  - insert x val : insert an element with key x
  - extract : print out the minimum in the heap and delete it
  - delete x val : delete the node which has key x and value val
  - decrease x val y : decrease the key by y on the node which has key x and value y
  - quit : terminate the program
- AVL tree
  - search x : Print out the balance factor (or color) of the tree node if the element x exists. If the element x does not exist, print out Not found\n.
  - insert x : Add an integer x to the red-black/avl tree. If x already exists, do nothing.
  - delete x : Delete the element x if the element x exists.
## Java (Programming Design 2)
- Java program syntax
- Java Fx / scene builder
- Procrastination : Android Studio APP project
  An App for a course "psychology of procrastination" usage. Including 4 main functions, login/logout, and local databases.

## C (Programming Design 1)
- template of bubblesort
- xor cipher
- decimal to binary converter
- casear encryption and decryption
- others...(few hw of PD1)
